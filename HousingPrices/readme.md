House Prices Prediction
This repository contains code and experiments for predicting house prices using classic and advanced regression models, including linear regression and gradient boosting. The workflow was inspired by the Kaggle House Prices which can be found in the link below:

https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques

The notebook starts with exploratory data analysis, focusing on visualizing the most relevant housing features and their correlation with sale prices. Preprocessing steps such as handling missing data and basic feature engineering are applied to create a robust dataset for modeling. 
All models are evaluated by their R2 scores. The final evaluation is performed on the competition "test" set; the training is based on the full "train" set without an additional train-test split.
