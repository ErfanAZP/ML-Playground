The first project is binary classification on predicting crack vs non-crack laser welded steel-copper lap joints. The dataset was obtained from mendeley repository cited below:

Rinne, Jonas (2021), “Screening datasets for laser welded steel-copper lap joints ”, Mendeley Data, V2, doi: 10.17632/2s5m3crbkd.2

The input features include:

- Welding process parameters: welding power (W), welding speed (m/min), shielding gas flow (l/min), focal position (mm), and angular position.

- Material/fixture context: block and strength provide run grouping and material strength context associated with each weld condition.

- Geometry measurements: weld width in steel (µm), weld width in copper (µm), weld depth in copper (µm), and joint gap (µm) capture bead geometry and fit-up quality that influence cracking.

- Other fields: weld number (each parameter combination was welded 5 times), position on weld path (mm), along with crack count and length, offer identifiers and supplemental crack characterization beyond the binary label.
  

Output label: 

crack is encoded as 1 for crack and 0 for non-crack to support supervised classification from the above features.

This analysis performs EDA, preprocessing, light feature engineering, and model pipelines for binary classification (crack=1, non-crack=0) using Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest, evaluated with grouped cross-validation and reported via ROC-AUC/F1; see the Jupyter Notebook file for exact steps to reproduce.
